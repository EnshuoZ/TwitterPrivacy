# TwitterPrivacy
In today’s web-enabled world, all information is available on the internet. Social media platforms also attract an increasing number of users to share their information. However, this has led to privacy breaches becoming a growing problem. Despite the measures taken by social media platforms to protect personal privacy and the setting of privacy preferences, users can still compromise their own or other people’s privacy for personal or other reasons. This project has developed a plugin that allows users to detect privacy breaches when posting new content to Twitter.
